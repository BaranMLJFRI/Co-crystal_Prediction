# Computational screening for prediction of co-crystals: method comparison and experimental validation

This repository is dedicated to the research and results presented in the paper. 
It contains all the necessary codes and datasets that were used in the ML study. By providing these resources, we aim to facilitate the reproduction of our scientific results and support open research.

## Repository Contents

- `code/`: This directory contains all the source code used for ML modeling, data analysis, and generation of figures.
- `data/`: Here you'll find the datasets that were analyzed in the study, which include [SMILES of all data (test and training datasets, and independent dataset) and structural descriptors used for modeling].
